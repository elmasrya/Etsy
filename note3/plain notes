http request is using the browser and url

REST is an architecture style. The web can be viewed as REST-based architecture.
In http, there are two different roles: the client and the server. The browser
is the client.

CRUD: is a way to create, read, update, or delete information on a server using simp;e HTTP calls.

CREATE is an endpoint

Create=post
read=get
update=put
Delete=delete
response=payload, because you are getting a lot of data

Endpoint: the url will come from the backend developer or documentation.

.........................................................................
Read request: I'm sending over a get request

A put is less taxing on the processing

Homework: header and footer not required

make one picture and loop it

iterate over the first variable



var cont = $(),

  song_image, song_title, song_mp3, track;

  song_imaage="<img src='' + song.artwork_url + "'/>'';

  //Build image title

  song_title="<p>" + song.title + "</p>"

  song_mp3="<"audio controls src=" + song.stream_url + jlfhgsdghdljghsdl>"  

rocktracks.forEach(function (song) {

  console.log(song.title);

  cont.text(song.title)

  cont.append(song.title)
});
